# Shop
This project was created to show my skils and what I already can use in practice.
I used Django, Botstrap, sqlite3 as database for build my site, my goal was to create an e-commerce web-site for my parent's shop of chldren clothes. I made it just for myself to check and consolidate my knowledge, because I knew that this site will not deploy in internet(the reason is my parants dont want own web-site).
Using currrent web-site you can choose product what you like from main page or from subcategory page or with search field help pick it and see more information and choose size what you need. Also you can add product to your card and do order. On navbar you have a couple buttons: "Main page", "About Us", "Contacts", "Cart" - at the right side and search field, name of shop (with link to main page) - left side. On every page you can see category and subcategory navigation. 
In this project I did not have register ang logging users, user account but I have it in my another repository "blog-python-". 
Thank you for attantion
